description: 'XMR is not just a niche cryptocurrency like many others; it represents the strongest iteration of what Satoshi described. Similar to cash, no one can trace a transaction back to you. However, it is more powerful than cash because no government can print additional units, allowing it to preserve its value just like Bitcoin.'
